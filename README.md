#Thrust

Thrust is a fast, lightweight PHP5 framework.  In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, I believe that Thrust will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.

Thrust is very early in its development.  In-fact at the time of writing this, I only have about 200 lines written.  I have big plans for Thrust, but I want your input.  I want Thrust to be all about the community.  After all, you are the people that use it.  Let me know what you would like to see in Thrust at [http://thrust.uservoice.com](http://thrust.uservoice.com).


##Requirements

The planned requirements for Thrust are as follows:

* PHP 5.2 or greater
* Any web server

That's it! Nothing else.

##Roadmap

Coming soon.  Help define it by [submitting your ideas here](http://thrust.uservoice.com).
