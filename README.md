#Fuel

Fuel is a fast, lightweight PHP5 framework.  In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, I believe that Fuel will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.

Fuel is very early in its development.  In-fact at the time of writing this, I only have about 200 lines written.  I have big plans for Fuel, but I want your input.  I want Fuel to be all about the community.  After all, you are the people that use it.  Let me know what you would like to see in Fuel at [http://fuel.uservoice.com](http://fuel.uservoice.com).

##Development Branch

This is the development branch.  The code contained in this branch may not be stable, and should not be used in a production environment.

##Requirements

The planned requirements for Fuel are as follows:

* PHP 5.2 or greater
* Any web server

That's it! Nothing else.

##Roadmap

Coming soon.  Help define it by [submitting your ideas here](http://fuel.uservoice.com).
